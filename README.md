# RakutenTV_UI_Task_2021

In this Task i used;
 Cypress framework and get benefits of its structure like support file.
 Js as language
 Page object model as design pattern


To know;
 I added required test cases and one more negative scenario for each to increase coverage.
 All test cases are located in Integration file.
 POM files are added under Page objects.
 It could be added more test cases for the features but I didnt know the limitation.
 I installed faker by command 'npm i faker', you may need to do that.
 



To run locally:
 'npm install'
 'npm install cypress --save-dev'
 'npm init'
 'Cypress open' and click to start the test
